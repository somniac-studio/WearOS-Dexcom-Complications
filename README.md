Dexcom users rejoice, finally wearOS complications for your Dexcom G5 - G6 - G7 so you can have your own watchface!

As a type-1 diabetic with smart glucose tracking services it is ridiculous that this isn't already a thing.

Currently in Testing on a Galaxy Watch 4, 5 & Diesel Watch. The goal is to add a complication to WearOS that can intervally update with the Raw sensor
Data as opposed to the Dexcom Share Data. It's possible on a Garmin Watch and an Apple Watch with existing Dexcom API, so This is definitely possible!
